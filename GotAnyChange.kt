/* Given a list representing the values of coins that you possess, write a function that returns
 * the minimum amount of change that you CANNOT create. You may multiple coins with the same value.
 * If you are given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 1.
 * Verify your code by running GotAnyChangeTester.run() in main.
 *
 * Assumptions: All coins have a positive integer value.
 * Sample Input:  [22,7,1,1,2,3,5]
 * Sample Output: 20
