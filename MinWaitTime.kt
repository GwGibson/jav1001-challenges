/* You are given a list containing the amounts of time specific queries take to execute. Queries can only be
 * executed one at a time but you can execute the queries in any order.
 * Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time to execute all the queries in the list.
 * The waiting time is the amount of time that a query must take before it can begin execution.
 *
 * For example, if you are given queries of duration [7,1,22], then the total waiting time would be
 * 0 + (7) + (7 + 1) = 15. If we executed the queries in the order [22,1,7] then the total waiting time would be
 * 0 + 22 + (22 + 1) = 45.
 * Verify your code by running MinWaitTimeTester.run() in main.
 *
 * Assumptions: All waiting times are positive and the incoming list is not empty.
 * Sample Input:  [4,3,1,1,3,2,1,8]
 * Sample Output: 45
