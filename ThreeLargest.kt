/* Write a function that takes in an integer list and returns a list containing the three largest integers in the input list.
 * Do this without sorting the input list and ensure the returned list is sorted in ascending order.
 * The function should return duplicate integers. For example, it should return [7,7,22] for an input list of [22, 1, 2, 7, 7]
 * Verify your code by running ThreeLargestTester.run() in main.
 *
 * Assumptions: The incoming list has at least three integers.
 * Sample Input:  [5, 7, 1, 1, 22, 10]
 * Sample Output: [7, 10, 22]
