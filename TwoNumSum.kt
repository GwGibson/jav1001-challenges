/* Write a function that takes in an integer list and an integer representing a target sum. Determine if any TWO integers in the
 * list sum to the given target. If this condition is met, return the two integers in a list. If no two numbers in the list
 * can be added to reach the target sum, return an empty list.
 * Verify your code by running TwoNumSumTester.run() in main.
 *
 * Assumptions: The incoming list in not empty and contains distinct integers.
 * Sample Input: list = [13, 6, -4, 7, 0, 1, 22, -1]
 *               target = 9
 * Sample Output: [-4, 13]
